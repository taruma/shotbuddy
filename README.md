## ✨ Key Features (v3 Enhancements)

This version of Shotbuddy is packed with features designed to make your workflow faster and more organized.

### 🚀 Streamlined Project Management

- **Comprehensive Project Dashboard**: Get a bird's-eye view of your entire project with the responsive **Table of Shots (TOC)** panel. Filter, navigate, and see active vs. archived shots at a glance.
- **Effortless Shot Reordering**: Simply drag and drop shots to rearrange your sequence. Your story's flow is always just a move away.

- **Flexible Archiving & Naming**: Keep your main workspace clean by archiving inactive shots. Give shots human-readable names like "Opening Scene" instead of just `SH010` for better clarity.

### 🖼️ Powerful Asset & Version Control

- **First & Last Frame Variants**: Manage distinct opening and closing frames for each shot, complete with their own versions, prompts, and thumbnails.

- **Automatic File Organization**: Drag and drop your generated images or videos. Shotbuddy automatically versions them, archives old iterations in a `wip` folder, and keeps the latest version ready for your pipeline.

### 💡 Enhanced User Experience

- **Advanced Export Options**: Precisely select what you want to export. Choose between images, videos, or both, and even include metadata summaries for a complete project handoff.

- **Seamless Light/Dark Theme**: Switch between light and dark modes with a single click. Your preference is saved automatically for your next session.

## 📁 How It Works: Project Folder Structure

Shotbuddy automatically creates and maintains a clean, predictable folder structure for every project. This ensures your assets are always organized and easy to find.

```
project_folder/
├── shots/
│   ├── latest_images/    # The current, "promoted" image for each shot (e.g., SH010.png)
│   ├── latest_videos/    # The current, "promoted" video for each shot (e.g., SH010.mp4)
│   └── wip/              # Work-in-progress and old versions are archived here
│       └── SH010/
│           ├── images/   # e.g., SH010_v001.png, SH010_v002.png
│           └── videos/   # e.g., SH010_v001.mp4
└── project_info.json     # Metadata like title, version, and notes
```
